            - Overarching folder (ex 3HAA potatoes)
                - Repeats (ex Repeat_1)
                    - Full_condition_name (GLS130_control)

3.  Run Complile_data.m on the combined csv
        - will create experiment_compiled.csv

4.  Run Analyze_data_heatmap.m on the _compiled.csv 
        - will create experiment_analyzed.m
